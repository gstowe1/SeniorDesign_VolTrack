In addition, this course will provide training for students in funded undergraduate research programs. After the initial ethics and compliance training, students in these program will receive project-specific training as identified by the Principal Investigator(s). ",

Whereas a large company has a strong and well-defined structure and ample resources to deal with unexpected challenges, a start-up usually has insufficient resources and/or management experience, yet it must deal on a daily basis with important and often unpredictable forces. \n\nStudents will be exposed to these tensions and experience through problem-based learning methods that illustrate what it is like to start and grow a new company. The course will provide students with the knowledge and experience to increase their likelihood of success whether as a principal in a small company or an investor representative. \n\nManaging a Startup is a problem-based learning (PBL) course, where the learning is student-centered, with faculty acting primarily in the role of facilitators. Active learning happens in this course because students are engaged in the analysis of the complex situations that underlie startup companies. The course leverages the on-line course management system Canvas to define weekly learning objectives, support electronic delivery of assignments, and provide robust video content from entrepreneurs, investors and key employees, who provide additional insights into the management decisions and ethical dilemmas the leader of a startup faces.

This will include the full aspect of energy consumption including infrastructure, mining, energy storage, energy delivery, and waste disposal. As we discuss various countries and how they derive their energy, we will see that the proportion and the total amount of energy generated by the various technologies differ dramatically.
